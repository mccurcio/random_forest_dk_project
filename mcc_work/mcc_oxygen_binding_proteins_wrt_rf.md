# Prediction and Classification of Oxygen-binding Proteins using Random Forest machine learning

## Proposal

At the time of writing this proposal, oxygen-binding proteins have not been classified by Random Forest (RF) machine learning tools. S. Muthukrishnan, et al, have used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify oxygen-binding proteins using the amino acid (AAC) and the dipeptide (DP) compositions. Their paper *Oxypred: Prediction and Classification of Oxygen-Binding Proteins* achieved 85.5% for AAC and 87.8% for DP accuracy. Additionally, the classification of the oxygen-binding proteins into six clusters, erythrocruorin, hemerythrin, hemocyanin, hemoglobin, leghemoglobin, and myoglobin yielded >95% accuracy using AAC and > 85% using DP. Using the Uniprot database, it is possible to obtain two sets of proteins one including oxygen binding versus non-oxygen binding. Using this database, it may be possible to determine if RF is comparable to SVM in its ability to classify.
